We really appreciate you taking the time to come do this for us. The game is simple: You are going to be given a claim and you need to correctly identify if it is true or false using the green checkmark and red X buttons at the bottom. We ask that you please complete the full five minutes and then answer some questions for us on the questionnaire we provided once you return back to this screen. Any and all feedback and criticisms are welcome, but please do keep in mind that the visuals are all placeholders until we complete some more finalized art for the game. Please pay attention to your score as you play and when the playtest is about to end so we can gather your final score in the questionnaire. Thank you again, please press the green checkmark when you are ready to begin!",  250, 6000, 0.1, 0.1, 0)
